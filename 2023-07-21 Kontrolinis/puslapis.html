        <h1>A Rockstar Games employee has accidentally leaked their involvement on GTA 6 and revealed an assortment of new details about the upcoming game.</h1>
        <p>GTA 6 is easily one of the most anticipated games of all time, but Rockstar has remained quite mum on details despite announcing the title was in development.
            Although leaks have confirmed a return to Vice City, the introduction of a female protagonist, and a variety of other gameplay updates, fans are still waiting for Rockstar to unveil an official trailer.            
            As they wait, however, some Rockstar employees have shared their work on GTA VI through LinkedIn and one new update seems to even suggest that the next Grand Theft Auto will see the return of chainsaws.</p>

        <h1>Rockstar Games employee accidentally leaks GTA 6 details</h1>
        <p>On LinkedIn, "Sayan Saha" a 2D/UI designer updated his bio to include references to GTA 6 and shared his involvement in the game.
            Although he ended up deleting portions about GTA 6, screenshots of the bio prior to its edit have surfaced revealing his work on the game.

            Fans are eager for a proper GTA 6 reveal.
            According to the bio, he worked on over “500 in-game 2D assets for GTA VI” including over 25 “unique brands.”

            Interestingly, his work also includes labels on items and listed off chainsaws, fire extinguishers, electric boards, boat motors, and car engines.
            This seems to suggest that GTA 6 will include chainsaws and fire extinguishers as weapons, which could be very fun to wield against NPCs or players in GTA Online 2.
            The dev further noted how he worked on signage, generic clutter such as certificates and forms, and items that appear in interior areas.</p>

        <h1>GTA 6 release date: When is GTA 6 coming out?</h1>
        <p>The GTA 6 release date is yet to be confirmed by Rockstar Games. That hasn't stopped internet sleuths from making some educated guesses. Multiple sources have corroborated a rumor that GTA 6 will release in 2025, which was part of a larger info drop which suggested that Grand Theft Auto 6 would be set in a modern-day Vice City. It's always wise to approach this sort of speculation with caution, but with the new GTA 6 leaks appearing to confirm a modernized Vice City setting, perhaps a release sometime in 2025 is right on the money. 
            TURNING TO THE CRYSTAL BALL FOR ANSWERS
            GTA Online
            I asked a psychic leading questions about the GTA 6 release date, and it was wonderfully weird            
            However, there are a few rumors that GTA 6 could launch in 2024. Initially, a Bloomberg article stated that  "current and former Rockstar staff reckon GTA 6 is still at least two years away from release, suggesting a 2024 launch." This was then backed up by Microsoft's latest response to the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation into its ongoing acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 
            In it, Microsoft wrote the following: "The highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI is expected to be released in 2024."
            So maybe the GTA 6 release date is closer than we expect?</p>
